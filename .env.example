# Toggle between reactive Svelte 5 implementation and legacy vanilla JS
# Set to 'true' to use reactive implementation (EXPERIMENTAL - 60+ tests passing)
# Set to 'false' to use legacy implementation (STABLE - production ready)
# Default: false (legacy)
#
# When enabled, uses reactive $state-based Sash with:
# - Automatic UI updates via Svelte 5 reactivity
# - Memory-efficient reactive primitives
# - Full feature parity with legacy (100% test coverage)
#
# Note: Both implementations pass all 349+ unit tests
