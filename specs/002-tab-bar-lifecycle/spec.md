# Feature Specification: Tab Bar Lifecycle & Customization

**Feature Branch**: `002-tab-bar-lifecycle`  
**Created**: 2025-10-13  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Tab Bar Lifecycle & Customization"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

Constitution-aligned notes:

- Include accessibility expectations per story (roles, labels, keyboard order, focus management).
- For component-driven features, specify the primary interactions that tests must cover
  using Vitest + `vitest-browser-svelte`.

### User Story 1 - Reorder Tabs with Persistence (Priority: P1)

Users can drag-and-drop tabs to reorder them, with smooth edge auto-scroll, and the new order persists so the tab strip feels predictable across sessions.

**Why this priority**: Reordering is central to power-user flow management and is referenced throughout the PRD; persistence ensures the product "remembers" how users work.

**Independent Test**: Mount a tab bar with 8+ tabs; simulate dragging a tab across the strip, including near-edge auto-scroll; verify the final order matches the drop position and that a persistence boundary is respected.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a tab bar with overflow, **When** a user drags a tab near the left/right edge, **Then** the bar auto-scrolls, enabling reordering beyond the visible range.
2. **Given** a set of tabs, **When** a tab is dropped at a new position, **Then** the order updates immediately and persists according to the defined persistence boundary.
3. **Given** keyboard-only usage, **When** the user invokes reorder actions, **Then** tabs can be moved left/right without requiring a pointer and with visible focus feedback.

---

### User Story 2 - Inline Rename with Validation (Priority: P2)

Users rename a tab directly in place with clear validation (no empty names, trimming, length limits), predictable commit/cancel, and immediate title sync.

**Why this priority**: Inline rename is a core customization behavior and ties directly to window title sync and workspace memory.

**Independent Test**: Activate rename on a tab; type valid and invalid names; verify commit on Enter/blur, cancel on Escape, and visible validation errors for empty/too-long names.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a tab in view, **When** rename is activated, **Then** the name becomes editable, with the current value selected for quick overwrite.
2. **Given** a trimmed empty input, **When** the user attempts to commit, **Then** an inline error appears, the name is not applied, and the editor remains active.
3. **Given** a valid name, **When** the user commits, **Then** the display updates immediately and the window title reflects the new tab name without noticeable delay.

---

### User Story 3 - Pinned Tabs and Tab Bar Controls (Priority: P3)

Users can pin/unpin tabs, see a clear pinned indicator, and rely on the tab bar to house companion controls (AI toggle, workspace switcher, add-tab) plus a configuration error indicator.

**Why this priority**: Pinning stabilizes key sessions, and the tab bar’s companion controls and status indicators are core to the product’s day-to-day usability.

**Independent Test**: Toggle pin on multiple tabs and reorder within the pinned region; verify the indicator, persistence of pin state, presence of controls, and the visibility of a config error badge when an error is injected.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a set of tabs, **When** a user pins a tab, **Then** it moves to the pinned segment with a thumbtack indicator and remains visible regardless of scroll.
2. **Given** a pinned tab is active, **When** it is activated again, **Then** a subtle activation animation plays and respects reduced-motion settings.
3. **Given** the system reports a configuration error, **When** the tab bar renders, **Then** a clear, discoverable error indicator appears within the tab bar with access to more details.

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

- Drag near strip edges without sufficient space: auto-scroll should engage within 150ms and not overshoot.
- Reorder across pinned/unpinned boundary: drag is restricted to within the current segment; crossing requires Pin/Unpin via context menu (FR-203, FR-212).
- Rename to an existing tab name: allowed by default; uniqueness is not enforced unless host requires it (assumption).
- Extremely long tab names: truncate visually with middle-ellipsis while preserving full name in tooltip; editing still shows full value.
- Many pinned tabs: pinned region must remain horizontally scrollable when overflowed without masking the regular tabs.
- Close active tab: focus should move to the nearest neighbor (left preference), falling back to right if no left neighbor exists.
- Multiple banners present: stack with priority; ensure tab bar remains usable and does not jump height.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-201 Reorder (DnD + Keyboard)**: Users MUST be able to reorder tabs via drag-and-drop with edge auto-scroll and via keyboard actions; the final order MUST update immediately on drop/commit and reflect in persistence.
- **FR-202 Pinned Region Behavior**: Pinned tabs MUST render in a distinct segment that remains visible regardless of scroll and supports reordering within the segment.
- **FR-203 Pin/Unpin Actions**: Users MUST be able to pin/unpin a tab via context menu and shortcut; pinning MUST move the tab into/out of the pinned segment without losing selection.
- **FR-204 Inline Rename**: Users MUST be able to rename a tab inline with validation rules: trimmed non-empty, and a maximum length of 60 characters. Commit on Enter/blur; Cancel on Escape.
- **FR-205 Title Sync on Rename**: On successful rename, the application MUST reflect the new tab name in the visible label and the window title without noticeable delay.
- **FR-206 Add/Close Transitions**: New tabs MUST appear with a smooth roll-in animation; closing a tab MUST remove it without shifting focus unexpectedly. Reduced-motion preferences MUST minimize animations.
- **FR-207 Overflow & Scrolling**: When tabs exceed available width, the bar MUST enable horizontal scrolling with mouse, trackpad, and keyboard access; tab widths MUST adapt to available space without overlapping controls.
- **FR-208 Context Menu**: Right-clicking a tab MUST provide actions: Pin/Unpin, Rename, Copy Tab ID, Background Presets, Close. Items MUST enable/disable based on state.
- **FR-209 Companion Controls**: The tab bar MUST include the AI toggle, workspace switcher, add-tab button, and a configuration error indicator. These controls MUST remain discoverable at common window widths.
- **FR-210 Focus & A11y**: All tab strip elements MUST have accessible roles/names; focus order MUST be predictable; screen readers MUST announce rename state and pin status.
- **FR-211 Persistence Boundary**: Tab order, pin state, and names MUST persist via a host-managed source of truth (host is primary). The renderer maintains within-session cache but defers to host values on load and on updates; host precedence is deterministic.
- **FR-212 Pinned/Regular Crossing**: Dragging between pinned and regular segments is restricted; use context menu actions (Pin/Unpin) to move a tab across segments. Drag reorders only within the current segment.
- **FR-213 Error Indicator Behavior**: When configuration errors exist, the indicator MUST be visible within the tab bar and provide a clear pathway to details without obstructing core interactions.
- **FR-214 Performance**: Dragging, rename, and scroll interactions MUST feel responsive; visual updates SHOULD complete within 16ms per frame under typical conditions.
- **FR-215 Reduced Motion**: When reduced motion is enabled, all animations MUST be simplified while preserving state clarity and focus feedback.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Tab**: Identifier, name, pinned flag, order index; emits rename and pin/unpin events.
- **TabBarState**: Collection of tabs (pinned + regular), overflow state, scroll position, and focus index.
- **Banner**: Type (config error, update, info), priority, message; determines presence of indicator within the tab bar.
- **DragState**: Source index, target index, segment (pinned/regular), edge proximity for auto-scroll.
- **PersistenceModel**: Source of truth for tab order/pins/names (host vs renderer) and conflict resolution policy.

### Assumptions

- Keyboard navigation and global shortcut handling are provided by the foundation feature; this spec adds tab-specific bindings only.
- Uniqueness of tab names is not required; duplicates are allowed unless the host enforces uniqueness.
- If host persistence is available, it provides initial tab metadata on launch; otherwise, session memory is sufficient for demo/testing.

### Out of Scope

- Cross-workspace tab moves, detached windows, or drag-out to create a new window.
- Detailed AI toggle and workspace switcher behavior (owned by their respective features); this spec covers only their presence and layout in the tab bar.
- Backend-side validation or service errors beyond displaying a non-blocking message for failed rename operations.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-201 Reorder Responsiveness**: Users can complete a tab reorder (drag start to drop) without visible jank; edge auto-scroll engages within 150ms and maintains at least 45 FPS on typical hardware.
- **SC-202 Rename Clarity**: 95% of rename attempts provide clear validation feedback; valid commits update the visible name and window title within 100ms of commit.
- **SC-203 Pinned Visibility**: Pinned tabs remain visible regardless of horizontal scroll 100% of the time; activation animation adheres to reduced motion preferences.
- **SC-204 Overflow Usability**: When tab count exceeds available width, users can access any tab (via scroll or keyboard) within 2 interactions on average.
- **SC-205 Indicator Discoverability**: Configuration error indicator is visible and actionable in 100% of injected error scenarios during testing without blocking other controls.
- **SC-206 Add/Close Transitions**: Add and close transitions complete within ≤200ms (ease‑out), and within ≤100ms when reduced motion is enabled.

### Quality Gates Traceability

- SC-201 ↔ User Story 1 (DnD reorder tests, performance budgets)
- SC-202 ↔ User Story 2 (rename validation and title sync tests)
- SC-203 ↔ User Story 3 (pin behavior and animation tests)
- SC-204 ↔ User Story 1 and 3 (overflow navigation tests)
- SC-205 ↔ User Story 3 (indicator visibility and interaction tests)
- SC-206 ↔ User Story 3 (add/close animation and reduced motion tests)

Accessibility assertions to validate:

- Tabs expose appropriate roles and names; pinned status announced to assistive tech.
- Rename mode announces editable state; focus returns predictably after commit/cancel.
- Reduced motion preference minimizes animations while preserving clarity.
