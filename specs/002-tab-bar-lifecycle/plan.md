# Implementation Plan: Tab Bar Lifecycle & Customization

**Branch**: `002-tab-bar-lifecycle` | **Date**: 2025-10-13 | **Spec**: /home/founder3/code/github/itlackey/sv-window-manager/specs/002-tab-bar-lifecycle/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-tab-bar-lifecycle/spec.md`

**Note**: Filled by the `/speckit.plan` workflow.

## Summary

Implement a reusable tab bar that supports: reordering (drag-and-drop + keyboard) with edge auto-scroll, pinned segment behavior and pin/unpin actions, inline rename with validation and title sync, overflow management with horizontal scroll, tab bar companion controls (AI toggle, workspace switcher, add-tab), and a configuration error indicator. Persistence authority is host-primary; renderer caches within session. Cross-segment drag is restricted; use Pin/Unpin to move between segments. Success criteria: 150ms edge auto-scroll engage, ≥45 FPS during drag, 100ms rename title sync, pinned tabs always visible, overflow access within ~2 interactions.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript + Svelte 5 (Runes)  
**Primary Dependencies**: SvelteKit (dev/packaging), `vitest`, `vitest-browser-svelte`, Playwright, Storybook  
**Storage**: N/A (UI state in-memory; persistence via host integration)  
**Testing**: Vitest browser for components, Playwright for E2E in demo  
**Target Platform**: Browser (desktop) and Electron renderer via host integration
**Project Type**: Svelte component library + demo app  
**Performance Goals**: ≥45 FPS during drag; auto-scroll engage ≤150ms; rename→title sync ≤100ms; add/close animations ≤200ms (ease‑out) and ≤100ms under reduced motion  
**Constraints**: Interactions target <16ms per frame; a11y keyboard/focus/ARIA required; reduced motion respected  
**Scale/Scope**: Up to ~200 tabs (combined pinned + regular) assumed typical upper bound for performance testing

## Constitution Check

Gate assessment before Phase 0:

- Reusability: PASS — Componentized tab bar; exported via `src/lib/index.ts`; styles minimal and overridable.
- Clean Code: PASS — TypeScript types for props/events; small focused modules; no dead code allowed.
- Tests: PASS — Plan includes Vitest browser tests for reorder, rename, pinning, overflow, and a11y.
- UX/A11y: PASS — Keyboard reorder, focus management, ARIA roles/names; reduced motion supported.
- DX: PASS — Quickstart docs to be added; Storybook stories with a11y addon.
- Svelte 5 Runes: PASS — `$props()`, `$derived`, `$state`; SSR safety for browser-only APIs.

**Structure Decision**: Single project (library + demo). Primary code under `src/lib/` with stories in `src/stories/` and demo in `src/routes/`. Tests co-located for components and E2E under `e2e/` for demo flows.
