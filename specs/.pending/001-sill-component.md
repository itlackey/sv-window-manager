# Sill and Pane Header Improvements

- Panes should support an icon prop that displays an icon next to the title
- we should allow the option to place a sill component anywhere on the page and the window manager should minimize windows to it
- windows should animate in and out of the minimized state
- the titles of minimized windows should be visible
