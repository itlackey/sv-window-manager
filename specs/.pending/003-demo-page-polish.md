# 003: Demo Page Polish

**Priority**: P1  
**Effort**: Small (8 tasks)  
**Status**: Pending  
**Dependencies**: Builds on completed 002-tab-bar-lifecycle

## Overview

Complete the demonstration page for the Tab Bar component, providing an interactive showcase of all implemented features with comprehensive controls, event logging, and accessibility testing capabilities.

## Context

The tab bar lifecycle features (reordering, rename, pinning, controls) are complete and functional. The demo page needs polish to effectively showcase these capabilities to library consumers and provide a testing ground for integration.

## Tasks Remaining

From `specs/002-tab-bar-lifecycle/tasks.md:L219-L235`:

- **T068**: Add comprehensive demo page header with feature overview and navigation
- **T069**: Create interactive playground section with all controls and toggles
- **T070**: Add event log panel showing real-time event emissions with timestamps
- **T071**: Add performance metrics display (FPS during drag, event timing)
- **T072**: Add accessibility testing controls (keyboard-only mode, screen reader mode)
- **T073**: Add theme switcher to demonstrate CSS custom property theming
- **T074**: Add code examples section showing how to use each feature
- **T075**: Add responsive demo showing TabBar behavior on different screen sizes

## Key Capabilities

### Interactive Playground

- Live tab manipulation (add, remove, rename, pin, reorder)
- Configuration toggles (reduced motion, overflow simulation)
- Theme switching demonstrating CSS variables
- Responsive viewport testing

### Event Logging

- Real-time event emissions with timestamps
- Event payload inspection
- Event history with filtering
- Performance timing information

### Accessibility Testing

- Keyboard-only mode toggle
- Screen reader simulation guidance
- Focus indicator highlighting
- ARIA role visualization

### Documentation

- Inline code examples
- Usage patterns and best practices
- API reference links
- Common integration scenarios

- **Implementation**: `src/routes/+page.svelte` (main demo page)
- **Component**: `src/lib/components/TabBar.svelte`
- **Stories**: `src/stories/TabBar.stories.svelte`
- **Tasks**: `specs/002-tab-bar-lifecycle/tasks.md`

## Success Criteria

- All 8 planned tasks (T068-T075) completed
- Demo page loads without errors
- All interactive controls functional
- Event log captures all tab bar events
- Performance metrics display during interactions
- Accessibility testing controls enable validation
- Code examples are accurate and copy-pasteable
- Responsive behavior works on mobile/tablet/desktop viewports

## Next Steps

1. Review existing demo page implementation in `src/routes/+page.svelte`
2. Identify which of T068-T075 are complete vs. pending
3. Implement remaining tasks in priority order
4. Validate demo functionality with manual testing
5. Document any discovered edge cases
