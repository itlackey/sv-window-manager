# 009: Cross-Feature Integration & Testing

**Priority**: P2  
**Effort**: Medium  
**Status**: Pending  
**Dependencies**: Multiple features complete (002, 004, 005, 006)

## Overview

Validate that all implemented features work together seamlessly, with end-to-end testing, integration tests, and system-level validation. Ensure data flows correctly between components and features interact predictably.

## Context

Individual features (001-008) have component-level tests and isolated functionality validation. This work focuses on:

1. **Integration testing**: Features working together (e.g., widget launches block in tab)
2. **End-to-end scenarios**: Complete user workflows across multiple features
3. **Data flow validation**: State synchronization, event propagation, persistence
4. **Performance profiling**: System behavior with multiple features active
5. **Edge case discovery**: Unusual interactions between features

## Key Testing Areas

### Feature Interactions

- **Tabs ↔ Blocks**: Active tab displays correct block layout
- **Widgets ↔ Blocks**: Widget launches create blocks in active tab
- **AI Panel ↔ Tabs**: AI can reference active tab context
- **Settings ↔ All**: Settings changes apply across all features
- **Modals ↔ Focus**: Modals don't break focus management in underlying features
- **Notifications ↔ Workflows**: Notifications don't interrupt user interactions

### Data Flow Scenarios

- **Workspace initialization**: All features load with correct initial state
- **Tab switching**: Active tab change updates all dependent features (blocks, widgets, AI context)
- **State persistence**: Settings, layouts, and preferences save and restore correctly
- **Event propagation**: User actions trigger appropriate events across feature boundaries
- **Host synchronization**: Changes sync to host backend without race conditions

### Performance Scenarios

- **Many tabs**: 20+ tabs with blocks, widgets, AI panel open
- **Large block layouts**: 10+ blocks per tab, switching between tabs
- **Long chat history**: AI panel with 100+ messages
- **Many widgets**: 50+ widgets in rail
- **Rapid interactions**: Quick tab switching, widget clicking, typing in AI

### Edge Cases

- **Empty states**: No tabs, no blocks, no widgets (graceful degradation)
- **Error states**: Backend failures, network errors, invalid data
- **Concurrent modifications**: Multiple components modifying shared state
- **Rapid state changes**: User actions faster than persistence can complete
- **Resource limits**: Low memory, slow CPU, large data sets

## Testing Strategy

### E2E Tests (Playwright)

Located in `e2e/`, testing complete user flows:

- **Workspace lifecycle**: Launch → restore tabs → modify → persist → reload
- **Tab operations**: Create, rename, reorder, pin, close, switch
- **Block management**: Add blocks, magnify, close, switch between blocks
- **Widget usage**: Click widget → block appears in active tab
- **AI interaction**: Open panel, send message, receive response, share context
- **Settings workflow**: Change settings → verify application across features

### Integration Tests (Vitest)

Testing feature boundaries and data flow:

- **Tab-Block integration**: Tab metadata → block layout → rendering
- **Widget-Tab integration**: Widget click → active tab receives block
- **AI-Context integration**: Context toggle → active tab/widget data included in query
- **Settings-Feature integration**: Setting change → all features update
- **Modal-Focus integration**: Modal open/close → focus returns correctly

### Manual Testing Scenarios

Exploratory testing for unexpected behaviors:

- Stress testing (many tabs, blocks, rapid actions)
- Platform-specific behaviors (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Accessibility testing (keyboard-only, screen reader)
- Visual regression (compare screenshots across versions)

- **E2E Tests**: `e2e/*.test.ts`
- **Integration Tests**: `src/lib/*.integration.spec.ts` (to be created)
- **Shell**: `src/lib/WindowManagerShell.svelte` (main integration point)
- **Types**: `src/lib/types.ts` (shared state interfaces)

## Success Criteria

### Integration Quality

- All E2E scenarios pass consistently (≥99% reliability)
- No race conditions in state updates
- Events propagate correctly across features
- Persistence works without data loss
- Error boundaries prevent cascading failures

### Performance Targets

- Workspace initialization < 500ms (cold start)
- Tab switch < 100ms (hot)
- Widget launch → block render < 200ms
- Settings change → application < 100ms
- AI message send → start streaming < 500ms

### User Experience

- No janky animations during feature interactions
- Focus management works in all scenarios
- State changes feel instant (no flicker or delay)
- Errors are user-friendly and recoverable
- Accessibility works across feature boundaries

## Test Scenarios (to be detailed)

### Scenario 1: Complete Workspace Lifecycle

1. Launch app (empty workspace)
2. Create 3 tabs with names
3. Add 2-3 blocks to each tab
4. Pin first tab
5. Open AI panel, send message
6. Launch widget → block appears
7. Change settings (theme, spacing)
8. Close and reopen → all state restored

### Scenario 2: Rapid Interactions

1. Open 10 tabs quickly
2. Switch between tabs rapidly (keyboard)
3. Launch multiple widgets in succession
4. Send AI messages while switching tabs
5. Change settings while interactions ongoing
6. Verify: no crashes, no UI corruption, no data loss

### Scenario 3: Error Handling

1. Disconnect backend during operation
2. Attempt tab operations → graceful error
3. Attempt widget launch → clear feedback
4. Attempt AI message → retry option
5. Reconnect → resume normal operation

### Scenario 4: Accessibility

1. Navigate entire app with keyboard only
2. Open and close modals, panels
3. Switch tabs, launch blocks
4. Send AI messages
5. Change settings
6. Verify: all actions possible, focus order logical, announcements clear

## Metrics to Track

- **Test coverage**: ≥80% across integrated features
- **E2E reliability**: ≥99% pass rate
- **Performance regressions**: Flag ≥10% slowdowns
- **Memory leaks**: No unbounded growth over 1-hour session
- **Bundle size**: Track total size, flag ≥5% increases

## Next Steps

1. Define integration test framework and helpers
2. Create E2E test scenarios covering key workflows
3. Implement shared state management (AppState, EventBus)
4. Add integration tests for feature boundaries
5. Set up performance profiling and regression tracking
6. Document manual testing procedures
7. Create checklist for pre-release integration validation
