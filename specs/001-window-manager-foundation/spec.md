# Feature Specification: Window Manager Foundation — Initialization, Global Interaction, and Layout Skeleton

**Feature Branch**: `001-window-manager-foundation`  
**Created**: 2025-10-12  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Window Manager Foundation - Initialization, Global Interaction, and Layout Skeleton"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

Constitution-aligned notes:

- Include accessibility expectations per story (roles, labels, keyboard order, focus management).
- For component-driven features, specify the primary interactions that tests must cover
  using Vitest + `vitest-browser-svelte`.

### User Story 1 - Gated Initialization and Ready Reveal (Priority: P1)

On app launch, the window hides startup flicker, applies appearance and zoom settings, preloads essential workspace data, then reveals the UI and signals "ready" to the host.

**Why this priority**: Without a smooth, controlled reveal, the entire experience feels unstable. This is the base every other feature builds upon.

**Independent Test**: Launch the UI in a test harness with a mocked data source that resolves after a short delay; verify hidden state before data-ready, proper application of appearance settings upon reveal, and a single ready signal emitted.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the app has launched and initial data is not yet available, **When** the UI starts, **Then** the window remains visually hidden (no flicker), and no content is interactable.
2. **Given** initial appearance settings are available from the host, **When** the UI reveals, **Then** zoom/opacity/transparency are applied immediately and consistently.
3. **Given** initial data has finished loading, **When** the UI reveals, **Then** a single "ready" signal is emitted to the host with the current tab title.
4. **Given** a platform preference for reduced motion, **When** the UI reveals, **Then** animations are minimized and focus outlines remain visible.

### User Story 2 - Global Keyboard and Context Menu Framework (Priority: P2)

From the first frame, users can rely on consistent keyboard behavior (focus traversal, tab navigation, side panel toggle) and a right-click context menu that adapts to selection and clipboard contents.

**Why this priority**: Keyboard and context menus are core affordances for power users and accessibility; they must exist early to shape all subsequent features.

**Independent Test**: Verify keyboard shortcuts fire expected actions without conflicting with common platform conventions; simulate right-click with/without text selection and with URL-like clipboard content to confirm menu item adaptations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the app is focused, **When** the user presses the defined shortcuts for tab navigation, **Then** the focus target changes accordingly with visible feedback.
2. **Given** the side panel toggle shortcut, **When** the user invokes it, **Then** the panel shows/hides and focus is managed to remain predictable.
3. **Given** a right-click without selection and an empty clipboard, **When** the menu opens, **Then** only general actions are shown (e.g., Copy disabled, Paste disabled).
4. **Given** a right-click with URL-like text selected or present in clipboard, **When** the menu opens, **Then** an "Open Link" action is available.

### User Story 3 - Layout Skeleton with Side Panel Container (Priority: P3)

The foundational layout renders a tab bar region, a primary workspace area for blocks, and a resizable side panel that remembers visibility and width during the session. This side panel initially hosts an example component to validate layout and focus behavior.

**Why this priority**: Establishing the shell ensures all future components have predictable mount points and focus/resize behavior.

**Independent Test**: Render the layout with no data; verify that regions exist with proper roles/landmarks and that side panel visibility and width persist across toggles within a session.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a fresh session, **When** the UI loads, **Then** the tab bar, main workspace, and side panel container are present with accessible labels/roles.
2. **Given** the side panel is hidden, **When** the user toggles it, **Then** it appears at the last used width within the same session.
3. **Given** the window is resized, **When** the layout updates, **Then** regions adapt without overlap and maintain focus order.
4. **Given** the requested workspace cannot be found, **When** the UI loads, **Then** the main workspace shows an accessible "Workspace Not Found" state with a retry action and clear guidance.

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- Initial data fetch is slow or fails: the UI should remain hidden until a minimum skeleton is ready; if failure persists beyond a 1.5–2.0s fallback timeout, reveal with a clear "Loading" or "Error" state in the main region and allow retry.
- Reduced-motion preference is enabled: all animations must be minimized without losing state clarity or focus feedback.
- Platform-specific shortcuts conflict: provide safe fallbacks and avoid hijacking OS-level keys.
- No workspace data found: show a graceful "Workspace Not Found" state with descriptive messaging in the main region.
- Clipboard contains large content: context menu should remain responsive and avoid parsing that blocks the UI.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001 Initialization Gate**: The UI MUST delay visual reveal until essential startup steps complete (appearance applied, initial data resolved or timeout reached) and MUST emit a single readiness signal to the host upon reveal.
- **FR-002 Appearance Application**: The window appearance (zoom, opacity, transparency, background color/image) MUST be applied on first paint and update live when settings change.
- **FR-003 Keyboard Handling**: The application MUST provide consistent keyboard navigation and shortcuts for core actions (focus traversal, tab navigation, side panel toggle) without conflicting with platform conventions.
- **FR-004 Context Menu Framework**: Right-click MUST open a context menu whose items adapt to selection and clipboard contents (e.g., enable/disable Copy/Paste; show Open Link for URL-like content).
- **FR-005 Layout Skeleton**: The UI MUST render distinct, labeled regions: Tab Bar (toolbar/region), Main Workspace (main), and Side Panel (complementary) with responsive resizing behavior.
- **FR-006 Side Panel Session Memory**: The side panel MUST remember visibility and last width for the duration of the session; reinstatement MUST be instantaneous when toggled.
- **FR-007 Flash Error Overlay**: Transient errors MUST be displayed in an unobtrusive overlay with click-to-copy content and auto-expire behavior.
- **FR-008 Accessibility Baseline**: All interactive elements MUST have accessible names/roles; focus outlines MUST be visible; reduced motion preferences MUST be respected globally.
- **FR-009 Title Sync on Reveal**: The window/tab title MUST reflect the current tab name at reveal time and update on rename without noticeable delay.
- **FR-010 Resize Responsiveness**: Resizing the window or toggling the side panel MUST reflow regions smoothly without overlaps or content jumps.

Uncertain but important requirements (limited to max 3):

- **FR-011 Ready Signal Contract**: Emit a single event named "ready" within 100ms after visual reveal; payload includes only the current tab title. No duplicate emissions allowed per launch.
- **FR-012 Preference Persistence Boundary**: Use a hybrid model. Renderer remembers side panel visibility and width within-session; when host persistence is available, host-stored values take precedence at launch and on update. Renderer local cache serves as fallback only.
- **FR-013 Shortcut Precedence**: Shortcut keys are configuration-driven. By default, the application may override OS/host for a minimal allowlist of core shortcuts (e.g., tab navigation, side panel toggle). Consumers can override or disable any shortcut to avoid conflicts, including opting to defer to OS/host for specific keys.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **WindowAppearance**: Represents zoom, opacity, transparency, background color/image; updates may arrive during runtime.
- **WorkspaceState (summary)**: Minimal data required at launch (client, window, tabs metadata, current tab title) to enable reveal and title sync.
- **TabShell**: Placeholder object describing the existence of pinned and regular tabs (without implementing tab operations in this spec).
- **PanelState (Side Panel)**: Visibility (shown/hidden) and width value remembered within the session.
- **FlashError**: Transient error entry with message, timestamp, expiry; supports click-to-copy content.
- **ContextMenuItem**: Label, enabled/disabled state, and optional action dependent on selection/clipboard analysis.

### Assumptions

- The host provides initial appearance settings and minimal workspace data before reveal; if unavailable, the UI uses safe defaults and reveals after a short timeout with a clear loading state.
- Side panel is hidden by default on first run; renderer remembers the state within the session. If host persistence is present, host-provided values override on launch and updates.
- No terminal execution or AI chat functionality is included in this spec; only the layout shell and interaction frameworks.

Note on defaults:

- Default keyboard binding name for side panel toggle is `togglePanel` (configurable by consumers).

### Out of Scope (for this feature)

- Full tab management (creation, close, drag-reorder, pin behavior) beyond placeholders.
- Example component’s domain logic (data fetching, business rules) beyond layout validation; future specs will introduce app-specific components.
- Widget rail configuration and non-trivial widgets.
- Workspace creation/deletion or persistent storage mechanics.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001 Reveal Smoothness**: Users observe no startup flicker; UI reveals within 500ms after initial data is ready (or timeout triggers fallback state).
- **SC-002 Input Responsiveness**: Global shortcuts respond within 100ms. A minimal, documented allowlist may override OS/host defaults by design; conflicts are configurable and can be disabled by consumers.
- **SC-003 Context Menu Relevance**: In 95% of tested cases, the context menu shows relevant actions (Copy/Paste enablement; Open Link when URL-like content is available).
- **SC-004 Accessibility Baseline**: All primary regions and controls are keyboard reachable with visible focus indicators; respects reduced motion preference across the app.
- **SC-005 Ready Signal**: A single "ready" event is emitted within 100ms of visual reveal and includes the current tab title.
- **SC-006 Panel Toggle Performance**: Toggling the side panel completes layout transition in under 150ms with width remembered during the session.

### Quality Gates Traceability

- SC-001 ↔ User Story 1 (E2E and component-level layout tests)
- SC-002 ↔ User Story 2 (keyboard handling tests)
- SC-003 ↔ User Story 2 (context menu tests)
- SC-004 ↔ All stories (a11y assertions in component tests and Storybook)
- SC-005 ↔ User Story 1 (host readiness signal tests)
- SC-006 ↔ User Story 3 (layout reflow tests)

Accessibility assertions to validate:

- Landmarks/roles present for toolbar/tab bar, main workspace, and complementary side panel.
- Focus order predictable across toggles/resizes; visible focus outlines present.
- Reduced motion preference honored for transitions and animations.
