- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Clarifications resolved by product:
  - FR-011: Emit a single "ready" event ≤100ms after reveal with current tab title.
  - FR-012: Hybrid persistence with host precedence; renderer caches within session.
  - FR-013: Configuration-driven shortcuts; minimal allowlist may override OS; consumers can override/disable.
